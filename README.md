# -Palindrome-Checker
A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward, such as "racecar" or "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama." A palindrome checker is a program or algorithm designed to determine whether a given input is a palindrome or not.
